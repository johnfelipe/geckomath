0. Dependencies
---------------

Geckomath depends on a working LaTeX distribution at the moment.  For Windows,
you just need to visit

    http://miktex.org/2.9/setup

to obtain the most recent release of MiKTeX.  The ONLY requirement is
`pdflatex`, so the most basic distribution is good enough; no need for TeX
editors or anything else.  Geckomath calls `pdflatex` from the command line.

1. Installation
---------------

LaTeX is the only dependency, and otherwise Geckomath is completely stand-alone:
no installation required.  Simply double-click `geckomath.exe` to run.
